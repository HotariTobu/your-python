## Constraint

- All code, comments, and documentation must be written in English

## Design Philosophy

- Prioritize elegant design and theoretical correctness over working code
- Prioritize future extensibility over current functionality
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term stability

## Code Changes

- Prefer large-scale, comprehensive changes over minimal fixes
- Prefer complete rewrites over patching existing code
- Make breaking changes freely; no need to maintain backward compatibility
